# [RAT RACE!](https://doityourseph2.github.io/rat-race/)

[![Rat Race title card](rat-race.png)](https://doityourseph2.github.io/rat-race/)

Made with p5.js and [p5play](https://p5play.org).

An interactive simulation representing our shared corporate struggles through animals to encourage discussion.
Tapping into our shared obsession of the self-defeating pursuit of money, power, and status... our struggles are simulated within this artwork, with a light-hearted tone in mind.

By incentivizing users to reward the rats within the simulation, we invite them to question the worth of the corporate rat raceâ€™s rewards and the inevitabilities the experience entails.
